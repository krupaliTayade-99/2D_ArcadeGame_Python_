# 2D_ArcadeGame_Python_
Developed a 2D Aracade game 'Meteorite Attack' using Python (Turtle & TKinter modules)
The game consists of 5 levels, in each level player gets 5 lives with different aspects of spaceship design, background and most important, the increasing speed at each level as it goes up.
Working of scoreboard in each level was similar, following a rule of deduction of score by 10 and life by 1 on every head on collision of spaceship with the Meteorites. Increment in the score by 10 when spaceship gains energy bolts falling alongwith Meteorites.
Here, is the brief about my miniproject :)
